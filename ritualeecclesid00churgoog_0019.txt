Sacramentary of Gregory, where the correct reading is
neither obvious nor certain. It was conceived most ex-
pedient, therefore, to retain the errore as they stand in
the text, leaving it to the ingenuity, or the research,
ol each render to amend them, as his skill or learning
may best enable him to do.

d 9. It will be observed, that the greater portion of
the volume is accompanied by an interlinear version into
the Saxon language,l a circumstance which contributas
highly to the value of this publication. We are here
presented with by far the most copious, as well as, the
earliest, and consequently the purest, specimen of the
ancient language of Northumbria which has yet been
given to the public. Not only does it supply words
unknown to our lexicographem, Somner and Lye, neither

’ of whom had the opportunity of inspecting it; but, what

is perhaps still more valuable, it illustratas some points
in the structure and history of the Saxon language,
which, without its aid, might, perhaps, have remained

for ever in ohscurity.² ’

‘The Editor is requested to present to the Dean and
Chapter of Durham‘the thanks of the Surtees Society for
the liberty afforded to him and them of making the con·
tents of this valuable manuscript more generally known.
